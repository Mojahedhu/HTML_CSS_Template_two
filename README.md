# HTML_CSS_Template_two
Continuing my programming journey, Iâ€™ve completed my second project using HTML and CSS.

The original graphic design of this project is credited to the GraphBerry website, and the original code was created by the talented software engineer Osama Elzero. My goal was to recreate this project as part of my learning process.

In this version, I implemented a modern CSS feature called selector nesting, which was not available at the time the original project was coded by Osama Elzero.

I hope this project showcases my progress and dedication to learning. I am deeply grateful to everyone who has supported me in this journey, especially Osama Elzero, GraphBerry, and all the contributors working behind the scenes to make learning resources available.
